					<h1 class="-center;">What exactly is WOTD</h1>
					<p>Originally made popular by Crossfit community, the WOTD or <i>Workout Of The Day</i> is simply a session that revolves around a predetermined number of sets and repetitions of different exercises to be timed for completion. As these workouts are pre-planned by qualified coaches, it takes the technical burden of planning an effective workout off your shoulders so you could enjoy working out stress free.</p>

					<p>WOTD is simply structured so you get to workout one on one with a certified personal trainer on a per session basis without the commitments of any membership packages. Our workouts are ideal if you are on a time constraint or simply curious about how to embark on a healthier lifestyle but not quite ready for the commitment that a gym membership or personal training entails.</p>
