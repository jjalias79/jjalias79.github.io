					<h2>What exactly is WOTD all about</h2>
					<p>A routine synonymous with the Crossfit community, the WOTD or <i>Workout Of The Day</i> is simply a session that revolves around a predetermined number of sets and repetitions of different exercises to be timed for completion.</p>
					<p>As these workouts are pre-planned by a qualified coach, it eliminates the technical component of planning a fruitful workout so you could enjoy working out fuss free.</p>
					<p>To ensure a fun and yet challenging session, our custom WOTDs are designed daily via our central team of senior WOTD coaches.</p>
					<p>This custom WOTD is then issued to our regional coaches who will be training you. Depending on the your fitness profile, the assigned coach then may (or may not) personalise your WOTD to best cater to your abilities.</p>
					<p>Consider it a personal bootcamp. So go ahead and break a sweat. Book your first WOTD session today.</p>
