					<h2>What exactly is WOTD all about</h2>
					<p>A routine synonymous with the Crossfit community, the WOTD or <i>Workout Of The Day</i> is simply a session that revolves around a predetermined number of sets and repetitions of different exercises to be timed for completion.</p>
					<p>As these workouts are pre-planned by a qualified coach, it eliminates the technical component of planning a fruitful workout so you could enjoy working out fuss free.</p>
					<p>To ensure a fun and yet challenging session, our custom WOTDs are designed daily via our central team of senior WOTD coaches.</p>
					<p>This custom WOTD is then issued to our regional coaches who will be training you. Depending on your fitness profile, the assigned coach then may (or may not) personalise your WOTD to best cater to your abilities.</p>
					<p>Consider it a personal bootcamp. So go ahead and break a sweat. Book your first WOTD session today.</p>

					<h2>Why should I choose WOTD</h2>
					<ul>
						<li><p>Safety under the watchful eye of a qualified coach.</p></li>

						<h2>Who is WOTD suitable for</h2>
						<p>WOTD is structured primarily for you to reap the benefits of an ala carte one on one workout with a certified personal trainer but without the commitments of any membership or PT packages. Our workouts are ideal if you are on a time constraint or simply curious about how to embark on a healthier lifestyle but not quite ready for the commitment that a gym membership or personal training entails.</p>
